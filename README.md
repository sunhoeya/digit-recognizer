# Digit Recognizer with PyTorch

This project is a aimple digit recognizer built using PyTorch to recognize handwritten digits (0â€“9). It was developed and tested in Google Colab.

##  Features
- Preprocesses and trains on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset.
- Implements a fully connected neural network that learns to classify digits.
- Evaluates performance on a separate test dataset.
- Allows uploading custom digit images for live inference.

##  Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- Pillow (PIL)
- (Optional) Google Colab for easy setup and execution

##  How to Run
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sunhoeya/digit-recognizer.git
